Taylor is a sustainability professional with experience in project management focused on greenhouse gas accounting, energy efficiency, and waste reduction. Through her experience at Patagonia and in the consulting world, she has developed a strong background in data management, visualization, and analytics as it relates to climate goals. On top of having a technical environmental engineering background, she is also skilled at building relationships across an organization to catalyze climate goals. Taylor received her B.S. Environmental Engineering from Marquette University. 

At the UCSB Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, Taylor is specializing in corporate environmental management with a focus in strategic environmental communication and media. Her goal is to create regenerative systems in a corporate environment that could design waste and pollution out of systems altogether.

Taylor also enjoys some pretty rad hobbies like surfing, skiing, biking, hiking, and as of recent, SCUBA diving. She loves enjoying the natural environment she is working to protect. She also believes no act of kindness is ever wasted.

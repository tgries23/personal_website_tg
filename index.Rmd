## Howdy! 

I am a sustainability professional looking to solve problems in the apparel industry. I received a Bachelors of Science in Environmental Engineering from [Marquette University](https://www.marquette.edu/engineering/) back in 2017. I gained experience in sustainability consulting after school before joining [Patagonia's](https://www.patagonia.com/home/) Environmental Responsibility team. At the [UCSB Bren School of Environmental Science and Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/), I am specializing in corporate environmental management with a focus in strategic environmental communication and media. My goal is to create regenerative systems in a corporate environment that could design waste and pollution out of systems altogether. I will be interning with [REI's](https://www.rei.com/) Impact team this upcoming summer.

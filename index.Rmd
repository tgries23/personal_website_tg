Howdy! 

I am a sustainability professional looking to solve problems in the apparel industry. I received a Bachelors of Science in Environmental Engineering from Marquette University back in 2017. I gained experience in sustainability consulting after school before joining Patagonia's Environmental Responsibility team. At the UCSB Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, I am specializing in corporate environmental management with a focus in strategic environmental communication and media. My goal is to create regenerative systems in a corporate environment that could design waste and pollution out of systems altogether. I will be interning with REI's Impact team this upcoming summer. 


Take a look around!

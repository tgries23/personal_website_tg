    "contents": "\nThe Great Pacific Garbage Patch is a copious amount of waste that has stockpiled over time in the Pacific Ocean. A 27-year old from the Netherlands named Boyan Slat founded The Ocean Cleanup, a nonprofit to tackle the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. He created a half-mile-long trash-trapping system named “Jenny” with the goal to collect data and also collect trash - about 63,000 lbs to be exact in late July. Jenny completed its testing phase and has made nine trash extractions in its 12-week cleanup phase, collecting nearly 20,000 lbs of trash in one extraction. The goal is “to deploy enough cleaning systems to reduce the size of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch by 50% every five years and to initiate a 90% reduction in floating ocean plastic by 2040”. According to The Ocean Cleanup, the patch covers an area twice the size of Texas or three times the size of France and there could contain 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic; however, NOAA has said it can be hard to get a true estimate of this due to constantly changing borders and content. The Ocean Cleanup is working on a larger-scale cleaning system to be released in the summer of 2022. The founder projects that 10 full-scale cleaning systems will be needed to clean the patch at a rate of 20,000 tons per year. This would mean the patch would be reduced by 50% in five years. The Ocean Cleanup says “95% of the plastic it collects can be recycled” and they are working on finding solutions to upcycle the collected trash through unique partnerships. One of the biggest challenges for The Ocean Cleanup is funding. Upcycling ocean waste is one stream of income, but the organization relies on philanthropic, commercial, and governmental donations/sponsorships.\nThe Great Pacific Garbage Patch is essentially a garbage vortex located in the middle of the northern Pacific Ocean. The patch is split into two sections, the Eastern and Western Garbage Patch, which covers the coasts of Hawaii to California and from the Hawaiian islands to Japan. The garbage patch forms from trash merging with the North Pacific Subtropical Convergence Zone. This is where warm water from the South Pacific intersects with colder water from the Arctic, resulting in a vortex that circulates the accumulated garbage (American Oceans, 2021). Convergence results from the combined effects of the wind-driven surface-ocean currents, Earth’s rotation, and, ultimately, friction. The entire Great Pacific Garbage Patch is bounded by the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Gyres are large systems of swirling ocean currents. The gyres are areas of low pressure that spin clockwise around but are steady in the center similar to a hurricane. The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre is formed by four currents rotating clockwise around an area of 20 million square kilometers: the California current, the North Equatorial current, the Kuroshio current, and the North Pacific current (National Geographic, 2012). Since most plastics are not biodegradable, they keep accumulating over time, breaking down into microplastics. These plastics are harmful to marine life and disturb marine food webs in the gyre.\nReferences:\n“Great Pacific Garbage Patch.” National Geographic Society, National Geographic, 9 Oct. 2012, https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/great-pacific-garbage-patch/.\n“What Caused the Great Pacific Garbage Patch?” American Oceans, American Oceans, 26 Feb. 2021, https://www.americanoceans.org/blog/how-great-pacific-garbage-patch-created/.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nThis past year, a new social media star emerged - one that offers opinions on clothing sizes on the internet. One example of this internet phenomenon is Remi Bader. She is a 26-year old that has gained more than 1.4 million followers on the social media platform Tik Tok (Farizan, 2021). She offers comic relief on the topic of inconsistent sizing among popular brands for plus-size women and highlights the struggle many women face with weight gain/loss due to hormones, pregnancy, health conditions, etc. A study concludes that even imagining trying on a swimsuit will worsen women’s moods (Pappas, 2012). Brands like Youswim offer relief to this problem. The brand offers four styles of seemingly simple bathing suit designs in a small selection of colors, but the beauty of their product is that the swimsuit fits a size 2-14. Youswim increases customers’ willingness to pay and lowers costs by creating a long-term, “one-size” investment for women which aligns with the brand’s ability to create an inclusive network of women that promote the brand.\nYouswim’s product inherently increases customers’ willingness to pay which drives down production costs simultaneously. The brand currently sells one swimsuit in twelve colors and four styles. One can first argue that the customer is willing to pay more because they technically only need one swimsuit (if maintained well) for the rest of their life. This is a thought inconceivable by most since the fashion industry has been created on the foundation of continuously buying more as trends go in or out of style. Youswim defies the norm with its timeless, high-quality product. Since customers only need to buy one swimsuit, they would theoretically be open to paying more for the one-time investment instead of a new swimsuit every season. In fact, the brand saves money for the customer - instead of paying hundreds of dollars over a few years for swimsuits, they only need to spend $140 on one. This in turn creates a unique synergy with lowering production costs. Typically swimsuit brands need to create a swimsuit in 14 - 16 sizes, each in different patterns and colors. If a certain size or color does not sell, then the swimsuit will go on sale, impacting profits. Having one consistent swimsuit made would most likely save the brand money in production, and it would save time with inventory planning as well.\nThe main barrier to entry is the network of marketers Youswim has able to create through the “magic” of its product. When most people hear about a swimsuit that fits twelve sizes, they don’t believe it. It takes seeing others, who are a range of sizes, trying it on before their eyes to believe the product works. When one first feels the product, the material is thick and shrunken in to look like it would fit only a size extra-small. It takes trying on the swimsuit or seeing others try on the swimsuit to be amazed. Once someone feels the magic of the swimsuit themselves, they become a part of the network that passes the amazement on to others in their circle. This network continues to outwardly grow as the topic of inclusive sizing becomes more mainstream in the apparel industry. The brand also highlights diversity, inclusivity, and sustainability that creates intangible value for their target customer-based - typically these issues intersect for a customer who values inclusive sizing. This is useful to the brand because the networkers act as free marketing, potentially lowering overall marketing costs.\nAlthough Youswim’s product is innovative and presumably cost-effective, there are a few issues that could harm its long-term profitability. First, there are no known trademarks on the material or swimsuit design. Also, the brand has a high, but achievable, buy-in because customers can be skeptical of the fit. So, there is no guarantee that another company won’t try to reproduce Youswim’s model. Youswim has struck a balance between encompassing inclusivity, sustainability, and diversity in its brand which is largely relevant to today’s customer base’s value, but the real value comes from the strong network already in motion. Based on the model that they sell a “swimsuit for life”, they should be constantly targeting new customers. Youswim achieves alignment in its value chain through inclusive sizing because it opens up the pathway to consistent new networks. Youswim is not a brand that only fits one type of body, it is a swimsuit for all. So when one person wears a Youswim swimsuit in public, any women no matter their size, is a potential customer. I believe this is what will keep them profitable in the future. Even if another brand copied every detail from Youswim’s strategy, they would still need to put a lot of time and effort into building that network that Youswim already has acquired. Although another brand can eventually gain a customer base, Youswim will already be one step ahead.\nAlthough there are brands that provide one-size clothing, there is no brand currently that provides a guaranteed lifetime fit on a swimsuit. Swimsuits have been a major point of frustration for women because of sizing. Some women end up having to buy new swimsuits each season, which ultimately leads to more consumption, waste, and frustration. Youswim has been able to tap into these customers’ specific needs, increasing willingness to pay more for one long-term investment. This in turn helps Youswim as a business by lowering costs and creating a competitive advantage through a network of brand supporters. If one influencer gained 1.4 million followers on the topic of inclusive sizing alone, Youswim is addressing an important, relevant problem.\nReferences\nFarizan, D. (2021, May 20).

I am a natural problem-solver and exercised these skills through my technical degree and love for climbing. I helped co-found Marquette’s Rock Climbing Club which enriched my love for the outdoors. I then moved to Denver to chase the mountains and to pursue a career in sustainability. I worked for Overlay Consulting, where I was contracted by both the City of Denver and the City of Boulder to design and manage their building energy efficiency programs. In 2018, I was invited to speak at the Sustainable Denver Summit on the success of the Energize Denver program, where the city reported a 4.5% reduction in city energy use. Being drawn to sustainable outdoor apparel, I accepted a position with Patagonia’s Environmental Responsibility team in Ventura, CA. I supported Patagonia’s carbon neutrality and renewable energy goals by serving as the focal point for metric and inventory aggregation and streamlining carbon accounting methodology. I also accelerated progress towards Patagonia’s zero waste goal through developing the program strategy and methodology. At the Bren School, I am specializing in corporate environmental management with a focus in Strategic Environmental Communication and Media. My goal is to create regenerative systems in a corporate environment that could design waste and pollution out of systems altogether in the apparel industry.\n\n\n\n",

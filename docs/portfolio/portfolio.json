Overview\nThis report provides an exploratory overview of the differences in juvenile Snowshoe hares in Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest through exploring annual hare trap counts between 1999 and 2012 and female and male juvenile hare weights in the following grids: Bonanza Riparian, Bonanza Mature, and Bonbs. This report also explores the relationship between juvenile hare weight and hind foot length. Bonanza Creek LTER is part of the US Long Term Ecological Research Network. The Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest (BCEF) was established in 1963 is a 50 km^2 experimental forest located approximately 20 km southwest of Fairbanks, Alaska (Kielland et al.Â 2017). Through data wrangling, data visualization, test sampling, summary statistics, and regression calculation, this report provides an exploratory analysis of juvenile Snowshoe hares.\n2. Data and methods\nKnut Kielland, Stuart F. Chapin, and Roger W. Ruess conducted capture-recapture studies of snowshoe hares at 5 locales in the Tanana Valley, from Tok in the east to Clear in the west from 1999 to 2012. The data contain observations for adult and juvenile Snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) (Kielland et al.Â 2017). The initial investigation began with visualizing annual juvenile snowshoe hare traps to understand the population size, maximum and minimum counts, mean, and general trends. There is a general downwards trend in the number of juvenile hare trappings, especially between the years 2000 - 2001. This report also explores juvenile hare weights by sex and grid by finding the mean, standard deviation, and sample size. Weight between female and male hares was compared by two-sample t-tests using a significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) of 0.05. Linear regression explored the relationship between hare weight and hind foot length. All analyses are in R version 4.0.2 using RStudio version 1.3.1056.\n\n\nhide\n\n# Attach packages\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(effsize)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\n\n\n\n3.

The mean juvenile hare trappings count is 31.5. There is a general downwards trends in the number of juvenile hare trappings, especially between the years 2000 - 2001. No hares were trapped in 2002 and 2009. It would be recommended to standardize the trapping collection process to ensure accurate data.\nB.

From this visualization, it appears that sex does not have an impact on weights in juvenile hares since the means are similar for male and female hares. The visualization also shows that there is more data in the Bonanza Riparian grid vs the Bonbs grid, and that sex was not recorded for all data points.\nC.

While the absolute difference in means is 90.47 g (a 10.05% difference), the difference in means is significant (Welchâs two-sample t-test: t(325.02) = 2.71, p = 0.007), and the effect size is moderate (Cohenâs d = 0.29).\nD.

Linear model summary: \\(\\beta\\)1 = 9.52 g mm-1, p < 0.001, R2 = 0.3, Pearsonâs r = 0.55). Data: Kielland et al.Â (2017).\nThe relationship between juvenile snowshoe hare weight and hind foot length initially seem linear (Figure 3). Simple linear regression reveals that juvenile Snowshoe hare hind foot length does not strongly predict juvenile snowshoe hare weight (p < 0.001, R2 = 0.3) with an average slope of \\(\\beta\\) = 9.52 g mm-1 (i.e., for each millimeter increase in hind foot length we expect an average increase in weight of 9.52 g). Hind foot length and weight are moderately and positively correlated (Pearsonâs r = 0.55, p < 0.001). Diagnostic plots (not included) reveal normally distributed and homoscedastic residuals. I would suspect this model would require a logarithmic regression due to its shape, but further investigation is required.\n4. Summary\nExploratory data analysis reveals the following initial findings:\nThe number of juvenile hares trapped between 1999 and 2012 has decreased significantly\nJuvenile hares weight does not vary much between males and females\nThe most data was collected on the Bonanza Riparian grid for male and female juvenile hares\nJuvenile hare weight vs hind foot length linear model summary: \\(\\beta\\)1 = 9.52 g mm-1, p < 0.001, R2 = 0.3, Pearsonâs r = 0.55)\nNext steps:\nComplete multiple regression to fully understand the relationship between sex, weight, sampling site, and hind foot length.\nUpdate sampling measures to ensure data is complete and accurate.\n5.

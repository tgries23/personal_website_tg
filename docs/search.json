      "contents": "\n\nAs a child, I used to sit with my head out of the window on long road\ntrips, scribbling the mountain tops with my fingertips. It was cathartic\nfor my young mind, contemplating what I had learned during my\nenvironmental education lessons at camp in Rocky Mountain National Park.\nBetween crafting water filtration devices out of rocks or painting using\nleaves, I learned to love the natural environment through direct\nconnections with others and the world around me. These creative and\nwelcoming experiences in outdoor education led to me studying\nenvironmental engineering.\nMy interest in corporate environmental management began after I was\nselected to join Marquette University’s newly formed sustainability\ncommittee to strategize long-term climate goals in 2016. While\ncollaborating alongside the university’s leaders and peers who shared my\npassion, I realized that no singular institution, no matter how\nprogressive, how passionate, or how well-funded, could solve the climate\ncrisis alone. Transforming our current system will require partnership\nacross organizations. Change not only requires but also demands\ncollaboration and innovation which are strengthened by an analytical\nmindset and a scientific approach. I began to understand corporate\ninfluence and industry-wide collaboration during my contract role on\nPatagonia’s Social and Environmental Responsibility team. At Patagonia,\nI developed the strategy and methodology surrounding 2025 zero-waste\ngoals. I also supported Patagonia’s carbon neutrality and renewable\nenergy goals by serving as the focal point for metric and inventory\naggregation, researching industry best practices, and streamlining\ncarbon accounting methodology. Lastly, I helped manage Patagonia’s Higg\nBrand & Retailer Module self-assessment, Green-e® certification, and\nScience-Based Target Initiative development.\nI have also gained experience in energy efficiency, benchmarking, and\ndata analysis in my consulting roles. While in a consulting role in\nColorado, I received the honor to attend and present at the Sustainable\nDenver Summit where I spoke about the success of the Energize Denver\nprogram. Within one year of reporting for buildings greater than 50,000\nsquare feet, the city reduced its energy consumption by 4.5%, totaling\n$13.5 million in energy cost savings. While managing this required\nprogram, I engaged and educated program members through supporting both\nweb-based and in-person trainings, wrote up website content, and created\ndata visualizations. While at Partner Energy in Los Angeles, I managed\nclient’s energy and water benchmarking, utility data collection, and\nanalysis for energy performance programs such as Fannie Mae and Freddie\nMac Green loans, HUD Annual Benchmarking, and ENERGY STAR Certification.\nAt the Bren School, I am specializing in corporate environmental\nmanagement with a focus in Strategic Environmental Communication and\nMedia. My goal is to create regenerative systems in a corporate\nenvironment that could design waste and pollution out of systems\naltogether in the apparel industry. I also will focus on environmental\njustice issues as it relates to the apparel industry.\nAs much as I enjoy my career in sustainability, I enjoy some pretty\ncool hobbies as well. I like to ski, snowboard, climb, hike, bike, and\nas of recently, SCUBA diving. I want to be outside as much as possible.\nI also believe no act of kindness is ever wasted, and try to carry this\nabove anything else. So go get outside if you can!\n\n\n\n\n",
